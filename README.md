# Scripted chatbots:
Scripted chatbots are classified as chatbots that work on pre-determined scripts that are created and stored in their library. Whenever a user types a query or speaks a query (in the case of chatbots equipped with speech to text conversion modules), the chatbot responds to this query according to the pre-determined script that is stored within its library.One of the cons of such a chatbot is the fact that user needs to provide their query in a very structured manner with comma-separated commands or other forms of a regular expression that makes it easier for the bot to perform string analysis and understand the query. This makes this kind of chatbot difficult to integrate with NLP aided speech to text conversion modules. Hence, these chatbots can hardly ever be converted into smart virtual assistants.
I've used the intents json file you can add as much as you want data in that file but they have to be structured the same way as in the file .
